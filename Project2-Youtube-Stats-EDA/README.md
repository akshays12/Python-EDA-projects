---

## Project Overview
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Youtube data to uncover trends and patterns in subscribers listings. We use libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**for cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
1. Analyze **categories, subscribers, and channel type** across different countries.
2. Understand **maximum subscribers** in last 30 days across countries.
3. Provide recommendations for subscribers based on insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains **995 entries and 28 features**, and it is taken from Kaggle. 
---

## Steps and Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Handle missing data**: columns with null values.
- **Remove duplicates**: to avoid skewed visualizations.

### 2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Data visualization
1. **Subscribers distribution**: 
   - Visualized the mean of subscribers across countries using **bar plots**.
     
2. **Channel type insights**:
   - Analyzed **channel distributions**.

3. **Subscribers vs video views**:
   - Used **scatterplot** to show the distribution.

4. **Max subscribers by country in last 30 days**:
   - Used **scatterplot** to show the calculated value.

5. **Total subscribers in month**:
   - Analyzed with multiple listings using **boxplots** to identify key contributors.
